<h3 class="section">2.6 Doubling</h3>

<p>Backgammon is played for an agreed stake per point. Each game starts
at one point. During the course of the game, a player who feels he has a
sufficient advantage may propose doubling the stakes. He may do this
only at the start of his own turn and before he has rolled the dice.

   <p>A player who is offered a double may refuse, in which case he
concedes the game and pays one point. Otherwise, he must accept the
double and play on for the new higher stakes. A player who accepts a
double becomes the owner of the cube and only he may make the next
double.

   <p>Subsequent doubles in the same game are called redoubles. If a
player refuses a redouble, he must pay the number of points that were at
stake prior to the redouble. Otherwise, he becomes the new owner of the
cube and the game continues at twice the previous stakes. There is no
limit to the number of redoubles in a game.
