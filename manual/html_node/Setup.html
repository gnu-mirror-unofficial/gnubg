<h3 class="section">2.1 Setup</h3>

<p>Backgammon is a game for two players, played on a board consisting
of twenty-four narrow triangles called points. The triangles alternate
in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The
quadrants are referred to as a player's home board and outer board, and
the opponent's home board and outer board. The home and the outer boards
are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board
called the bar.

   <p>An alternate arrangement is the reverse of the one shown here, with
the home board on the left and the outer board on the right.

   <p>The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's
home board. The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also
the opponent's one point. Each player has fifteen checkers of his own
color. The initial arrangement of checkers is: two on each player's
twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point, three on each
player's eight point, and five on each player's six point.

   <p>Both players have their own pair of dice and a dice cup used for
shaking. A double cube, with the numerals 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 on its
faces, is used to keep track of the current stake of the game.
