<h3 class="section">Output of an analysis</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">Chequer play analysis</h4>

<h4 class="subsection">Cube decision analysis</h4>

<h4 class="subsection">Game, match, or session statistics</h4>

   <p>You can get a summary of the analysis from the game, match, or
session analysis. The game analysis is a summary for the current game
whereas the match or session statistics is a summary of all the games
in the match or session. The match analysis is available in the GUI from
<code>Analysis-&gt;Match Statistics</code> or at the botton of exported files.

<h5 class="subsubsection">Chequer play statistics</h5>

   <p>This section provides a summary of the chequer play statistics. The
following information is available

     <ul>
<li><strong> Total moves          </strong>:
The total number of moves in the match. 
<li><strong> Unforced moves       </strong>:
The number of unforced moves, i.e., all chequer play decisions
which had more than one legal move. 
<li><strong> Moves marked xxx</strong>:
The number of moves marked <em>very good</em>, <em>very bad</em>
etc. The analysis will mark moves <em>very bad</em>, <em>bad</em>
etc. based on the threshold you've defined in the analysis
settings. <tt>gnubg</tt> can currently not automatically mark moves, e.g.,
<em>good</em>, but you can mark moves <em>good</em> yourself. 
<li><strong> Error rate (total)</strong>:
The first number is the total amount of normalised equity that
the player gave up during this game or match. The number in
parenthesis is the un-normalised counterpart; for money play the
all errors are multiplied with the value of the cube, and for match play
the total match winning chance given up by the player is reported. 
<li><strong> Error rate (per move)</strong>:
The error rate per move is the total error rate divided by the number of
<em>unforced moves</em>. Note that is different from Snowie 4 that
defines the error rate per move as the total error rate divided by the
total number of moves for both players, i.e., the sum of <em>total
moves</em> for both players. In general, your
error rate per move will be lower in Snowie than in <tt>gnubg</tt>. 
<li><strong> Chequer play rating</strong>:
<tt>gnubg</tt> will assign a rating for your chequer play ranging from
<em>Awful!</em> to <em>Supernatural</em>. See the description for the
<em>overall rating</em> below. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubsection">Luck analysis</h5>

   <p>This section provides information about how Ms. Fortuna distributed
her luck. The following information is available:

     <ul>
<li><strong> Rolls marked xxx</strong>:
The number of moves marked <em>very lucky</em>, <em>lucky</em>
etc. Moves marked <em>very lucky</em> are huge jokers that improve your
equity with more the +0.6 relative to the average equity. <tt>gnubg</tt>
normally uses cubeful 0-ply evaluations to calculate the luck, but you
can change that under the analysis settings. See below for a complete
overview of what is considered <em>very lucky</em>, <em>lucky</em>,etc. 
<li><strong> Luck rate (total)</strong>:
The total luck for this game or match reported both normalised
and unnormalised. 
<li><strong> Luck rate (per move)</strong>:
The luck rate per move reported both normalised and unnormalised. 
<li><strong> Luck rating</strong>:
Based on the luck rate per move <tt>gnubg</tt> will assign you a
humerous luck rating. See below for the possible ratings. 
</ul>

   <p>Thresholds for marking of rolls:

   <p><table><tr align="left"><td valign="top"><strong>Deviation of equity from average</strong>
</td><td valign="top"><strong>Roll is marked</strong>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">&gt;0.6         </td><td valign="top"><em>very lucky</em>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">0.3 - 0.6    </td><td valign="top"><em>lucky</em>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">-0.3 - 0.3   </td><td valign="top">unmarked
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">-0.6 - -0.3  </td><td valign="top"><em>unlucky</em>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">&lt; -0.6       </td><td valign="top"><em>very unlucky</em>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>Luck ratings:

   <p><table><tr align="left"><td valign="top"><strong>Normalised luck rate per move</strong>
</td><td valign="top"><strong>Luck rating</strong>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">&gt; 0.10         </td><td valign="top">Cheater :-)
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">0.06 - 0.10    </td><td valign="top">Go to Las Vegas immediately

<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">-0.06 - -0.02  </td><td valign="top">Better luck next time
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">-0.06 - -0.10  </td><td valign="top">Go to bed
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">&lt; -0.10        </td><td valign="top">Haaa-haaa
   <br></td></tr></table>

<h5 class="subsubsection">Cube statistics</h5>

   <p>This section provides a summary of the cube decision statistics: the
number of cube decisions, missed doubles, etc.

     <ul>
<li><strong> Total cube decisions</strong>:
The total number of cube decisions, i.e., the sum of no-doubles,
doubles, takes, and passes. 
<li><strong> Close or actual cube decisions</strong>:
Similar to "Total cube decisions", except that no-doubles are
only included if they're considered "close". <tt>gnubg</tt> considers a
cube decision close if the relavant equities are within 0.25 from
eachother or if the position is too good. 
<li><strong> Doubles, Takes, Passes</strong>:
The total number of doubles, takes, and passes in the game or
match. 
<li><strong> Missed doubles around DP, Missed doubles around TG</strong>:
The number of missed doubles around the double point and too good
point respectively. If the
equity is below 0.95 the position is considered to be around the
double point else it considered to be around the too good point. If
you miss doubles around the double point, it usually means that you
double to late, whereas missed doubles around the too good point means
that you're too greedy and play on for gammon when the position is
<em>not</em> too good. 
<li><strong> Wrong doubles around DP, Wrong doubles around TG</strong>:
The number of wrong doubles around the double point and too good
point, respectively. If you have missed doubles around the double
point that generally means that you double too early where you really
should hold the cube, whereas missed doubles around the too good point
means that you double positions where you really should play on for a
gammon or backgammon. 
<li><strong> Wrong takes, Wrong passes</strong>:
The total number of wrong takes and passes, respectively. 
<li><strong> Error rate (total)</strong>:
The accumulated cube errors for this game or match reported both
normalised and unnormalised. 
<li><strong> Error rate (per cube decision)</strong>:
The error rate per cube decision is the total error rate divided
by the number of <em>close or actual cube decisions</em>. 
Note that is different from Snowie 4 that
defines the error rate per cube decision as the total error rate divided by the
total number of moves for both players. In general, your
error rate per cube decision will be lower in Snowie than in <tt>gnubg</tt>. 
<li><strong> Cube decision rating</strong>:
<tt>gnubg</tt> will assign a rating for your cube decisions ranging from
<em>Awful!</em> to <em>Supernatural</em>. See the description for the
<em>overall rating</em> below. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubsection">Overall rating</h5>

   <p>The last section is the overall summary.

     <ul>
<li><strong>Error rate (total)</strong>:
The accumulated chequer play and cube decision errors reported by
normalised and unnormalised. 
<li><strong>Error rate (per decision)</strong>:
The error rate per decision is the total error rate divided
by the number of non-trivial decisions (i.e., the sum of <em>unforced
moves</em> and <em>close or actual cube decisions</em>). 
Again, please note that is different from Snowie 4 that
defines the error rate per decision as the total error rate divided by the
total number of moves for both players. In general, your
error rate per move will be lower in Snowie than in <tt>gnubg</tt>. 
An investigation of approximately 300 matches showed the on average
the <tt>gnubg</tt> error rate with be 1.4 times higher than your Snowie 4
error rate. 
<li><strong>Equivalent Snowie error rate</strong>:
For easy comparison <tt>gnubg</tt> will also print the total error rate
calculated by the same formulae as Snowie 4. 
<li><strong>Overall rating</strong>:
Based on your normalised error rate per move <tt>gnubg</tt> will assign
you a rating ranging from <em>Awful!</em> to <em>Supernatural</em>. See
the table below for the thresholds. 
<li><strong>Actual result</strong>:
The actual result of the game or match. For money game this is simply the
number of points won or lost during the game or match. For match play
the number is calculated as 50% added to the result of the game or
match in MWC. For example, losing a match or winning a match
corresponds to an actual result of 0% and 100%, respectively. Winning
1 point in the first game of 7 point match is worth 6% using Kit
Woolsey's match equity table, hence the actual result is 56%. 
<li><strong>Luck adjusted result</strong>:
The luck adjusted result is calculated as the <em>actual result</em>
plus the total unnormalised luck rate. This is also called "variance
reduction of skill" as described in Douglas Zare's excellent article
<a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~zare/vrskill.html">Hedging Toward Skill</a>. This should give an unbiased measure of the strengths of the
players. 
<li><strong>MWC against current opponent</strong>:
For match play <tt>gnubg</tt> will calculate your MWC
against the current opponent. The number is calculated as 50% - your
total unnormaluised error rate + your opponent's total unnormalised
error rate. If your opponent is really lucky but plays rather bad, this
number can become larger than 100%, since he due to the extra luck has
the possibily to give up even more MWC. However, <tt>gnubg</tt> will
report this number as 100%, and 0% for the opposite situation. Note
that this number is biased towards the analysing bot, e.g., a 0-ply
analysis a game between <tt>gnubg</tt> 2-ply and 0-ply will suggest that
0-ply is a favourite, which it is clearly not. For an unbiased measure
use the <em>luck adjusted result</em> above.
