<h3 class="section">2.4 Hitting and Entering</h3>

<p>A point occupied by a single checker of either color is called a
blot. If an opposing checker lands on a blot, the blot is hit and placed
on the bar.

   <p>Any time a player has one or more checkers on the bar, his first
obligation is to enter those checker(s) into the opposing home board. A
checker is entered by moving it to an open point corresponding to one of
the numbers on the rolled dice.

   <p>For example, if a player rolls 4 and 6, he may enter a checker onto
either the opponent's four point or six point, so long as the
prospective point is not occupied by two or more of the opponent's
checkers.

   <p><strong>White rolls 64 with a checker on the bar.</strong>

   <p>If White rolls [64] with a checker on the bar, he must enter the
checker onto Red's four point since Red's six point is not open. If
neither of the points is open, the player loses his turn. If a player is
able to enter some but not all of his checkers, he must enter as many as
he can and then forfeit the remainder of his turn.

   <p>After the last of a player's checkers has been entered, any unused
numbers on the dice must be played, by moving either the checker that
was entered or a different checker.
