<h3 class="section">2.3 Movement of the Checkers</h3>

<p>To start the game, each player throws a single die. This determines
both the player to go first and the numbers to be played. If equal
numbers come up, then both players roll again until they roll different
numbers. The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers
according to the numbers showing on both dice. After the first roll, the
players throw two dice and alternate turns.

   <p>The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player
is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward, to a
lower-numbered point. The following rules apply:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>A checker may be moved only to an open point, one that is not
occupied by two or more opposing checkers.

     <li>The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For
example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five
spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open
point, or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an
open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five
spaces from the starting point) is also open.

     <li>A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice
twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to
use, and he may move any combination of checkers he feels
appropriate to complete this requirement.

     <li>A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally
possible (or all four numbers of a double). When only one number can
be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can
be played but not both, the player must play the larger one. When
neither number can be used, the player loses his turn. In the case
of doubles, when all four numbers cannot be played, the player must
play as many numbers as he can.
