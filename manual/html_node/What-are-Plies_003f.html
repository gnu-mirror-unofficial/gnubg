<h4 class="subsection">12.5.4 What are Plies?</h4>

<p>A ply describes how far GNU Backgammon
evaluates the position. <em>0-ply</em> means that
GNU Backgammon estimates the worth of the
position as it is. A <em>1-ply</em> evaluation looks one
step deeper, i.e. it evaluates the position after making the best
possible move for each of the 21 different rolls and returns the
averaged result. <em>2-ply</em> is another roll further
and so on.

   <p>The more plies you choose, the more you strengthen
GNU Backgammon. Keep in mind that this
will also decrease the playing speed.

   <p>Note also that <em>0-ply</em> in GNU
Backgammon is equivalent to the
<em>1-ply</em> evaluation of Snowie.

   <p>It's possible that Snowie's is a <em>playing</em> ply
while gnubg's is a <em>position evaluation</em> ply. When
playing at 1-ply Snowie will make each possible move for the player's
roll (that's 1 ply) and analyze the resulting positions. Playing at
2-ply it will take each of those positions and make all the opponent
moves for all possible rolls (the 2nd ply) and then analyze the
resulting positions. In GNU Backgammon the
initial set of possible moves is taken for granted, i.e. not counted
as a ply, because gnubg's plies are position evaluation plies. Thus,
for each of those possible moves a 0-ply analysis is done. gnubg's
discounting of the first set of moves perhaps makes the counting seem
funny.

   <p>Looking at it a different way, if you give GNU
Backgammon a position and analyze it at 1-ply, it will
make all the moves for all possible rolls (the 1st ply) and then
analyze the resulting positions. With Snowie it will assume that the
position arose from a move (that's a pretend 1st ply) then make all
the moves for all possible rolls (the 2nd ply) and analyze them. This
time it's Snowie that seems to be counting strangely.
