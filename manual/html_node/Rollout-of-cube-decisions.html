<h4 class="subsection">Quasi-Random Dice</h4>

   <p>Quasi-Random Dice are used to reduce the element of luck in
rollouts. Instead of selecting purely random dice, <tt>gnubg</tt> will
ensure a uniform distribution of the first roll of the rollout.  If 36
trials is requested, one game will start with 11, two games with 21,
two games with 31, etc. In general, if n * 36 games is requested, n
games will start with 11, 2*n games with 21 etc. This is called
<em>rotation</em> of the first roll. Similarly, if n*1296 trials is
requested, the second roll will be rotated, such that n games will
start with 11-11, 2*n games with 11-21, 4*n games with 21-21, etc. The
third roll be also be rotated if the number of trials is proportional
to 46656.

   <p>Suppose a user stops a 1296 trial rollout after 36 games. The 36 games
would have had the following rolls for the first two rolls of each
game: 11-11, 21-11, 12-11, 31-11, 13-11, ..., 66-11 Obviously such a
rollout will give skewed results since the second roll was 11 for all
games! To avoid this problem <tt>gnubg</tt> will randomise the sequence of
rolls such that it is guaranteed that for any sample of 36 games you
have exactly one game with first roll 11, exactly one game with
second roll 11, etc. This is called <em>stratification</em>.

   <p><tt>gnubg</tt> will actually also rotate and stratify rollouts where the
number of trials are not multiples of 36, 1296, etc. The distribution of
rolls is obviously not uniform any longer in this case, but it will
still provide some reduction of the luck, i.e., no 37 trial rollout
will have 3 games with a initial 66.

   <p>Before the first game of a rollout, <tt>gnubg</tt> creates a psuedo random
array which it will use for all the games in the rollout. In effect it
has already decided the roll sequence it will use for up to 128 rolls
in every game of the rollout. In other words, for a normal rollout
where games don't go over 64 moves, every single game of every
possible rollout length has already had its dice sequence
determined. During the rollout of game n, sequence n will be used, for
game n+1 sequence n+1, etc. If it's a <em>rollout as initial
position</em>, then whenever the current sequence starts with a double,
the sequence is skipped and the dice routine moves on to the next
sequence. Say an <em>rollout as initial position</em> is about to start
using sequence 275, but that sequence begins with a double. The dice
routine moves to sequence 276. On the following game, it will use
sequence 277 (it remembers how many it has already skipped).

   <p>So, if you select <em>rollout as initial position</em> and 36 games,
then you will get a prefect set of rolls for games 1..30 and the first
6 rolls of the next perfect set (the same rolls you would have gotton
for games 31..36 if you'd asked for 1080 games or 10800 games or 92
games or whatever.

   <p>The dice sequence doesn't know how man trials it will be asked for, it
simply generates sequences such that for a normal rollout
(<em>rollout as initial position</em>) every 36 (30) games you get all
possible 1st rolls, every 1296 (1080) games get every possible first 2
rolls, every 46656 (38880) games you get full sets of 3 rolls, etc.
