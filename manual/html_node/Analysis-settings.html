<h4 class="subsection">8.3.1 Analysis settings</h4>

<p>You can configure how GNU Backgammon
analysis the match or game for you. This can be configured in the dialog
box that appears when choose Settings-&gt;Analysis.

<p class="noindent"><a name="Analyze-settings-dialog"></a>

   <p><strong>Analyze settings dialog</strong>

   <p>[[analysesettings.png]]

   <p>In the top left frame in this dialog box, you can select what to
analyze. GNU Backgammon is able to analyze
three different properties in a match.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Checker play

     <li>Cube decisions

     <li>Luck of each roll
        </ol>

   <p>In addition you can have the analysis to analyze just one of the
players, or both. There is also possible to set a limit of how many
moves to be analyzed at each position. When you're reviewing your match,
the number of analyzed moves will be limited to number in this field. 
However, if you want to analyze further moves in a particular position,
it's not a problem to do that later. The move that was actually done in
the match will be analyzed even if it is ranked below the number of
moves limit.

   <p>GNU Backgammon will also mark each move
or cube decision with Doubtful, Bad and Very bad. You can adjust the
limits in equity difference for which label to assign. This is done in
the frame box to the left. Notice, currently the Good and Very good
classes are not used.

   <p>You can also adjust the classes for what GNU
Backgammon considers lucky and unlucky rolls. The luck of
a roll is defined as the difference of equity after the best move after
rolled dice and the equity after best move averaged over all possible
rolls.

   <p>The right part of the dialog box is an evaluation setting for how
each move or cube decision should be evaluated in the analysis. For an
explanation of this settings, see the chapter called "[[Evaluation
settings]]".
