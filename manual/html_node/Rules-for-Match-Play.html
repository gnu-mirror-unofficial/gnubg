<h3 class="section">2.9 Rules for Match Play</h3>

<p>When backgammon tournaments are held to determine an overall winner,
the usual style of competition is match play. Competitors are paired
off, and each pair plays a series of games to decide which player
progresses to the next round of the tournament. This series of games is
called a match.

   <p>Matches are played to a specified number of points. The first player
to accumulate the required points wins the match. Points are awarded in
the usual manner: one for a single game, two for a gammon, and three for
a backgammon. The double cube is used, so the winner receives the value
of the game multiplied by the final value of the double cube.

   <p>Matches are normally played using the Crawford rule. The Crawford
rule states that if one player reaches a score one point short of the
match, neither player may offer a double in the immediately following
game. This one game with no doubling is called the Crawford game. If the
Crawford game is won by the trailing player then the double cube becomes
available in all subsequent games (and it's most often in the best
interests of the trailing player to double immediately in these games).

<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">Black wins 1 </td><td valign="top" width="25%">2</td><td valign="top" width="25%">1</td><td valign="top" width="25%">Allowed
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">White wins 2 </td><td valign="top" width="25%">4</td><td valign="top" width="25%">1</td><td valign="top" width="25%">Allowed
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">Black wins 1 </td><td valign="top" width="25%">4</td><td valign="top" width="25%">2</td><td valign="top" width="25%">Crawford Game
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">Black wins 2 </td><td valign="top" width="25%">4</td><td valign="top" width="25%">4</td><td valign="top" width="25%">Allowed
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">White wins 2 </td><td valign="top" width="25%">6</td><td valign="top" width="25%">4</td><td valign="top" width="25%">Allowed
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>In this example, White and Black are playing a 5-point match. After
three games White has 4 points, which is just one point short of what he
needs. That triggers the Crawford rule which says there can be no
doubling in next game, Game 4.

   <p>There is no bonus for winning more than the required number of
points in match play. The sole goal is to win the match, and the size of
the victory doesn't matter.

   <p>Automatic doubles, beavers, and the Jacoby rule are not used in
match play.
