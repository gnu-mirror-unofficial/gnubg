<h4 class="subsection">10.1.2 The depth to search and plies</h4>

<p>A <em>ply</em> is simply considered to be one turn by
a player. Any position can be evaluated at 0-ply. That means that GNU
Backgammon does not look ahead in the game to evaluate the position. 
When GNU Backgammon is evaluating a checker play decision, it looks at
all resulting positions after all the legal moves with the given dice
roll, and evaluates these position at the given ply. It's possible to
set the search depth by specifying the plies lookahead in any
evaluation settings dialog.

   <p>Snowie users: GNU Backgammon differs
from some other software, notably Snowie in that GNU
Backgammon zero ply is the same as Snowie 1 ply. In
the same way what is called 2-ply in GNU
Backgammon will therefore be similar to a Snowie 3-ply.

   <p>For GNU Backgammon, a 0-ply evaluation
of a move would be done by:

   <p>Build a list of all legal moves. For each move, take the resulting
board position and use the neural net to estimate the expected
percentage of wins/gammons/backgammons/losses/gammon losses/backgammon
losses. Rank the moves based on this evaluation.

   <p>For one ply, after doing the above step, GNU
Backgammon chooses the best n moves (where n is set by
the move filters). For each one, it takes the resulting position for
that move and goes through all 21 possible dice rolls for the
opponent. From these results, it works out the average expectation for
the initial move and ranks them. This is the same as Snowie 2 ply. You
can think of it as asking "what's my best move if I also consider
every possible dice roll and move my opponent might make?"

   <p>For 2 ply (Snowie 3 ply), a similar process is done, but this
time, not only are the opponents possible moves considered, but, for
each of these, the player on roll's next move will be considered as
well.

   <p>For a single move, on average there are about 20 legal moves to
consider.

   <p>When doing a one ply analysis/evaluation, for the top n moves
(from the move filter, GNU Backgammon needs
to consider 21 rolls by the opponent, 20 and possible legal moves per
roll) = 420 positions to evaluate.

   <p>Every additional ply will multiply the previous number of
evaluations by about 400 odd, which explains the huge difference in
playing speed/analysis speed between 0 ply and 2 ply settings. I don't
think many people would enjoy playing against GNU
Backgammon at 3 ply settings, where moves could take
minutes to be selected. It's also not clear that using much deeper
lookahead actually gains a lot in terms of playing strength - if you
really need better answers than 2 ply, rollouts are probably a lot
better.
