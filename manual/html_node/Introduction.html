<h2 class="chapter">Introduction</h2>

   <p>GNU Backgammon works on

     <ul>
<li>MS Windows operating systems
<li>Linux
<li>FreeBSD
<li>Solaris
<li>MacOS 10
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>GNU Backgammon is available in different languages

     <ul>
<li>English
<li>German (nearly finished)
<li>Italian (3/4 finished)
<li>Japanese (2/3 finished)
<li>Danish (1/4 finished)
<li>Turkish (1/4 finished)
<li>Icelandic (1/4 finished)
<li>French (not ready yet)
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>GNU Backgammon comes with

     <ul>
<li>A Graphical User Interface (GUI) with 2D- or 3D-Animation
<li>Including a selection of board designs to choose from
<li>Powerful but simple tools to change or create your own design
<li>You can choose colours, lighting, textures and even the perspective of the 3D board
<li>A command line modus (CLI) with support of the script language python
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>With GNU Backgammon you may play

     <ul>
<li>backgammon, nackgammon or hypergammon
<li>games, matches or sessions (<tt>gnubg</tt> adjusts its play always to the match score)
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>Gnubgs analysing functions allow you to

     <ul>
<li>get hints during the game
<li>evaluate positions
<li>use a tutor during the game
<li>use a "temperature map" which gives a graphical simple overview of the possible
results of the next dice roll
<li>analyse or rollout positions, games, matches or sessions (with probably the most
extensive controls to set speed and accuracy of any backgammon software)
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>You can

     <ul>
<li>setup, edit and save positions, games, matches and sessions
<li>replay games, matches and sessions
<li>record annotations
<li>explore doubling windows, gammon prices and similar cube theory, valuable
for money games and essential for match play
<li>store error rates for different players
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>GNU Backgammon imports matches and sessions from

     <ul>
<li>Fibs
<li>Gamesgrid
<li>TrueMoneygame
<li>Netgammon
<li>Snowie
<li>Jellyfish
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>GNU Backgammon exports positions, games, matches and sessions into

     <ul>
<li>*.pos
<li>*.mat
<li>plain text
<li>different html formats
<li>png
<li>LaTeX
<li>(Encapsulated) Postscript
<li>PDF
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>With GNU Backgammon you may choose between the following dice generators

     <ul>
<li>Manual dice settings
<li>from a file
<li>a dice generator created by the user
<li>Ansi
<li>Blum, Blum and Shub
<li>BSD
<li>ISAAC
<li>MD5
<li>Mersenne Twister
<li>www.random.org
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>GNU Backgammon comes with several databases for handling bearoffs and
match equities, i.e.

     <ul>
<li>larger bearoff databases (to be generated)
<li>databases for 1/2/3-chequer hypergammon (to be generated)
<li>a selection of several Match Equity Tables (METs)
<li>an interface to Hugh Sconyers huge databases for races and bearoffs
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>But don't forget ... GNU Backgammon is work in progress. Don't blame us if

     <ul>
<li>a feature isn't implemented yet
<li>a feature doesn't work correctly
<li><tt>gnubg</tt> crashes
<li>your system suffers after gnubg is installed
</ul>

<br><p>
   <p>Don't forget also ...

     <ul>
<li>it's free software (free as in "free speech", not in "free beer")
<li>we are all volunteers
<li>we need feedback and bug reports
<li>we need your help
</ul>
