<h4 class="subsection">12.6.8 What does epc mean?</h4>

<p>When bearing off checkers, you may notice a display showing the
current <em>epc</em> value (next to the display of
<em>Pips</em>). The epc display can be turned on or off
under menu <em>Settings &mdash;&gt; Options &mdash;&gt;
Display</em> (at least in the current version, as of June 2005).

   <p><em>epc</em> stands for Effective Pip Count, and is an
alternative measurement of the <em>goodness</em> of the
position. The usual pip count can be a misleading
<em>goodness</em> estimate when both players are bearing
off. What is more important (for making cubing decisions) is
<em>the expected number of rolls</em> each player needs
to bear off hes checkers.

   <p>The effective pip count is defined as this expected number of
remaining rolls, multiplied with the average number of pips in a roll,
which is 8.167. (The average number of pips in a roll would be 7 if
rolling a double wouldn't yield a double pip count &ndash; i.e. a double-6
yields 24 pips, not 12.)

   <p>Thus, epc takes into account not only the current pip count, but
also the expected pip wastage:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>effective pip count (epc) = pip count + expected pip wastage
        </ol>

   <p>An example:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Position: 5 checkers on the 1-point, 4 checkers on the
2-point.

     <li>Pip count: 5x1 + 4x2 = 13

     <li>epc: 2.189 (expected number of remaining rolls) * 8.167 =
17.878

     <li>Wasted: 17.878 - 13 = 4.878
        </ol>

   <p>It's clear (hopefully) that the expected pip wastage (and hence
the <em>epc</em>) increases with more checkers on lower
points (e.g. you get pip wastage when rolling a 6 to bear off a
checker from the 2- or 1-point).

   <p>It is further <a href="http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?effective+pip+count">explained on BackGammon Galore</a>, especially in a <a href="http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+1076">post by Douglas Zare</a>.

   <p>How do one calculate the epc then, or the expected number of
remaining rolls? Gnu BG uses the one-sided bearoff database, which
contains the change of bearing off the final checker in any given
number of rolls. A player would probably use some quite complicated
heuristics (please see the aforementioned post by Douglas Zare,
<em>and do get back here and explain it!</em>)
