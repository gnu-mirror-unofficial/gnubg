<h4 class="subsection">10.1.11 Cubeful vs. Cubeless</h4>

<p>In the evaluation settings dialog box you can specify whether or
not checker play should be evaluated cubeful. It's recommended that
you use cubeful evaluation. To get an understanding of what cubeful
checker play evaluations are, you can take a look at this position:

<p class="noindent"><a name="Cubeful-example"></a>

   <p><strong>Cubeful example</strong>

   <p>[[cubeful-ex1.png]]

   <p>In this position black has rolled 51 and he has a good position. 
If the position is evaluated cubeless the best move is 13/7. Black can
hope white does not roll 34 or 35 form the bar and has now a good
chance to close white out in the next few rolls. However if white
rolls one of the four hitting numbers from the bar, white will quite
soon have a really hot redouble. This redouble increases whites equity
so much that black actually should play this move safe. He should play
13/8 6/5. However if the evaluation was set to cubeless, an setting
which assumes white will never redouble, black should play 13/8.

   <p>Here's another example:

<p class="noindent"><a name="Cubeful-example-2"></a>

   <p><strong>Cubeful example 2</strong>

   <p>[[cubeful-ex2.png]]

   <p>This is from a 5 point match where black has 1 point and white has
3 points. Black wins the opening roll and considers playing 13/11 6/5
or 24/23 13/11.

   <p>If GNU Backgammon uses a cubeless
evaluation it will play 24/23 13/11. But if you're using a cubeful
evaluation it will play 13/11 6/5. Slotting with 6/5 is at this score
a better move even though it loses more gammons. The gammons black are
losing won't matter anyway, since black will turn the cube in the next
few rolls anyway. The slotting play also wins more gammons, and with
the cube tuned to 2, black should play towards gammonish positions at
this score.

   <p>You can read more about cubeful evaluations in the [[Appendix]].

   <p>It's recommended that you use cubeful checker evaluations.
