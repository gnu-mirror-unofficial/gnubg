<h4 class="subsection">8.4.2 Analysis panel</h4>

<p>You can also study your moves and cube decisions in more detail in
the analysis window, or analysis panel if you have checked Dock panels
in the Window menu. You can open this window by checking on Window-&gt;Analysis. If you have docked panels the analysis panel will
appear under the game record. The analysis window is basically the
same as the Hint window described in the "[[Playing a game or match]]"
chapter.

<p class="noindent"><a name="The-Analyze-pane"></a>

   <p><strong>The Analyze pane</strong>

   <p>[[analasyepane.png]]

   <p>In the figure you can see the analysis panel. At the top of the
analysis panel you will see three pull-down menus. The leftmost
pull-down menu is a comment on the cube decision. In the figure it is
a position where the player didn't double and the GNU
Backgammon's analysis of this is empty. There was
nothing wrong with not doubling in this position. The user can also
override GNU Backgammon's evaluation and
mark the cube decision as 'Doubtful', 'Bad' or 'Very bad'. Note that
the cube decision pull-down menu will only be visible when the player
has the cube available.

   <p>The next pull-down menu shows a simple analysis of the roll. The
roll in this position was 32. GNU
Backgammon's evaluation of this dice roll is also empty. 
It shows that this particular roll was -.162 equity worse than the
average roll. This means that the roll is a bit unlucky, but does not
qualify for being marked as an unlucky roll. The rolls are marked in
these categories: 'Very lucky', 'Lucky', 'Unlucky' and 'Very unlucky'.

   <p>The rightmost pull-down menu, shows the move which was done. In
this situation the move that was done was 3/off 2/off. This move did
not qualify for any mark. Moves that GNU
Backgammon don't like will be marked as 'Doubtful',
'Bad' or 'Very bad'. The user can also override GNU
Backgammon's evaluation and mark the move manually
with the pull-down menu.

   <p>The rest of the analysis window is a notebook of two pages. The
first page is the list of possible moves. The list is sorted in the
ranked order with the best considered move at the top. The moves are
sorted by equity or EMG. In the list in the figure there is only two
possible moves. The move that was actually done in the match, is
marked with red color. The only difference of this list of moves and
the list of moves in the hint window, is that this list does not show
the probabilities for each outcome of the game. If you want to see the
probabilities of the different outcomes, you can click on the button
labeled Details. This will then show you a list with these numbers.

   <p>The other page of the notebook is the cube decision analysis. This
analysis show exactly the same as in the Hint window described in the
chapter called "[[Playing a game or match]]". Note that the cube
decision page will only be available if there is a cube decision. It
will not be visible if the cube is not available to the player.

   <p>There is also a set of tool buttons in the analysis panel. These
buttons does exactly the same as the tool buttons in the Hint window,
which is described in the the chapter called "[[Playing a game or
match]]".
