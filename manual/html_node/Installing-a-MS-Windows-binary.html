<h3 class="section">Installing a MS Windows binary</h3>

   <p>For an installation of GNU Backgammon on MS Windows operating systems
you need at least this build from <a href="http://www.gnubg.org/downloads/windows/">gnubg</a>. 
You'll find a file <code>setup.exe</code>, which is approximately 11 mb. If you want
daily builds, go to Nardy Pillards page at <a href="http://users.skynet.be/bk228456/GNUBgW.htm">http://users.skynet.be/bk228456/GNUBgW.htm</a>
and read his documentation carefully. If you download everything, you'll have these
packages:

     <ul>
<li>setup.exe (Oysteins installation archiv from 20030727, including everything you need)
<li>gnubg-old-[date]Zip.exe (Nardy's daily snapshot, no 3d-board, old layout)
<li>gnubg-[date]Zip.exe (Nardy's daily snapshot, with 3d-baord and new layout)
<li>board-3Dfiles.exe (Package needed for 3D-support)
<li>locale_[lang].exe (Nardy's language packages)
<li>gnubg_nogui-[date]Zip.exe (Nardy's daily snapshot without Graphical User Interface)
<li>libpython22Zip.exe (Package needed for python support in the "no gui" version)
</ul>

   <p>Nardy's builds include a daily snapshot of the <code>gnubg.exe</code> and some addons. If you like
daily builds, get either the "old layout", the "new layout" or the "no gui" binary (*.exe). 
You may also download a language package for Windows. Be aware, that the translation is still
work in progress. Only the english and the german translation are (nearly) fully available.

   <p><strong>Part I (Main program)</strong>: After downloading the software "doubleclick" on <code>setup.exe</code>. You
will be asked whether you want to install GNU Backgammon for windows. Click on <em>yes</em>. In
the following window accept the license agreement and click on <em>next</em>. Then choose a
directory where GNU Backgammon shall be installed. After this select the MS Windows menu
entry and whether or not a desktop and a quick launch icon shall be created.

   <p>The installation program will install all necessary files on your disk and finally ask you
whether GNU Backgammon shall be launched or not. Now you are ready to play.

   <p><strong>Part II (Daily snapshots)</strong>: If you like current snapshots, get the files from Nardy's
page at <a href="http://users.skynet.be/bk228456/GNUBgW.htm">http://users.skynet.be/bk228456/GNUBgW.htm</a>. The files <code>gnubg-[date]Zip.exe</code>
or <code>gnubg-old-[date]Zip.exe</code> contain only the binary <code>gnubg.exe</code>.

   <p>If you like the new style with panels and a 3D-board layout get <code>gnubg-[date]Zip.exe</code> and the
additional package <code>board-3Dfiles.exe</code>. Doubleclick on the file, select your installation
directory and click on <em>extract</em>. Be catious: the binary will now overwrite the "old" <code>gnubg.exe</code>.

   <p>For the old layout (seperate windows, no 3D-board) choose <code>gnubg-old-[date]Zip.exe</code>. 
You will now have a second program file in you GNU Backgammon directory called <code>gnubg-old.exe</code>.

   <p><strong>Part III (Support for different languages</strong>: If there is a package supporting your
native language, you may download this package also. Doubleclick on the <code>locale_[lang].exe</code>,
and the installer will put all necessary files into your GNU Backgammon directory. After
copying the files a README file will open with instructions how to activate the language.

   <p><strong>Part IV (Command Line Interface)</strong>: For using the "non-gui" version of GNU Backgammon you
only have to additionally install <code>gnubg_nogui-[date]Zip.exe</code>. Again doubleclick on the
binary <code>gnubg_nogui-[date]Zip.exe</code>. Be aware that possible older version of
<code>gnubg-no-gui.exe</code> will be overwritten. Accept the warning and click on <em>ok</em>. 
Choose the directory of your GNU Backgammon installation and click on <em>extract</em>.

   <p><strong>Part V (Additional python support)</strong>: If you need additional support for the scripting
language python you also have to install the package <code>libpython22Zip.exe</code>.
