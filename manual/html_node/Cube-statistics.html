<h5 class="subsubsection">8.4.3.3 Cube statistics</h5>

<p>This section provides a summary of the cube decision statistics:
the number of cube decisions, missed doubles, etc.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Total cube decisions: The total number of cube decisions,
i.e., the sum of no-doubles, doubles, takes, and passes.

     <li>Close or actual cube decisions: Similar to Total cube
decisions, except that no-doubles are only included if they're
considered <em>close</em>. GNU
Backgammon considers a cube decision close if
the relevant equities are within 0.25 from each other or if the
position is too good.

     <li>Doubles, Takes, Passes: The total number of doubles, takes,
and passes in the game or match.

     <li>Missed doubles around DP, Missed doubles around TG: The
number of missed doubles around the double point and too good
point respectively. If the equity is below 0.95 the position is
considered to be around the double point else it considered to
be around the too good point. If you miss doubles around the
double point, it usually means that you double too late, whereas
missed doubles around the too good point means that you're too
greedy and play on for gammon when the position is
<em>not</em> too good.

     <li>Wrong doubles around DP, Wrong doubles around TG: The number
of wrong doubles around the double point and too good point,
respectively. If you have wrong doubles around the double point
that generally means that you double too early where you really
should hold the cube, whereas wrong doubles around the too good
point means that you double positions where you really should
play on for a gammon or backgammon.

     <li>Wrong takes, Wrong passes: The total number of wrong takes
and passes, respectively.

     <li>Error rate (total): The accumulated cube errors for this
game or match reported both normalized and unnormalized.

     <li>Error rate (per cube decision): The error rate per cube
decision is the total error rate divided by the number of
<em>close or actual cube decisions</em>. Note that
is different from Snowie 4 that defines the error rate per cube
decision as the total error rate divided by the total number of
moves for both players. In general, your error rate per cube
decision will be lower in Snowie than in GNU
Backgammon. Note that the reported number is
multiplied by 1000 in the default settings.

     <li>Cube decision rating: GNU
Backgammon will assign a rating for your cube
decisions ranging from <em>Awful!</em> to
<em>Supernatural</em>. See the description for the
overall rating below.
