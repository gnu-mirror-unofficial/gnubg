<h3 class="section">10.2 Appearance</h3>

<p>You can change the appearance of GNU
Backgammon. There is a lot of options to choose among and
you can have the board look like nearly anything. This section will help
you through some on the appearance customization.

   <p>To change the look of the board, you should click Settings-&gt;Appearance. This will open a dialog box like this:

<p class="noindent"><a name="The-appearance-dialog"></a>

   <p><strong>The appearance dialog</strong>

   <p>[[appearance.png]]

   <p>In this dialog box you see a preview picture of the board at the
right side, and you have notebook with options to the left.

   <p>There are two different board rendering engines in GNU
Backgammon. It's a 2 dimensional rendering engine which
is simple and fast, but still makes really good board images. The moves
can be animated.

   <p>The other board rendering type is a 3 dimensional board engine based
on OpenGL. This board rendering engine makes astonishing fine board
graphics, and animates the rolls and moves beautifully. You can even add
textures to your boards and checkers. However, the 3D rendering type
need a good modern graphic card which can take 3D hardware acceleration.

   <p>The leftmost tab in the appearance settings notebook is the General
option. You can here select between the 2D board or the 3D board. You
can also choose between different other settings. Most of the settings
here are self explanatory.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Warning</strong>

        <p>Don't forget to save your settings!! A lovely and painstakingly
crafted board setup can be lost if you don't faithfully do your Settings-&gt;Save settings.
