<h3 class="section">2.5 Bearing Off</h3>

<p>Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home
board, he may commence bearing off. A player bears off a checker by
rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker
resides, and then removing that checker from the board. Thus, rolling a
6 permits the player to remove a checker from the six point.

   <p>If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, the
player must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered
point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, the player is
permitted (and required) to remove a checker from the highest point on
which one of his checkers resides. A player is under no obligation to
bear off if he can make an otherwise legal move.

   <p><strong>White rolls 64 and bears off two checkers.</strong>

<pre class="example">

      |                  |   |    |  +--4--------&gt;

      +12-11-10--9--8--7-------6--5--4--3--2--1-+
     
</pre>
   <p>A player must have all of his active checkers in his home board in
order to bear off. If a checker is hit during the bear-off process, the
player must bring that checker back to his home board before continuing
to bear off. The first player to bear off all fifteen checkers wins the
game.
