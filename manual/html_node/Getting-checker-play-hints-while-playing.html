<p>If you want to get a hint of the best move or the best cube action
press the Hint button in the tool bar or the menu option
Analyze-&gt;Hint. 
This will open a hint window.

<p class="noindent"><a name="The-hint-window"></a>

   <p><strong>The hint window</strong>

   <p>[[hintwindow.png]]

   <p>This Hint window shows a list of all possible moves for the position
and dice roll. The different moves are sorted by how GNU
Backgammon ranks each move; there is one move on each
line in the list. The rest of the numbers may look a bit complicated and
cryptic but, once you learn what each number means, it isn't really that
bad.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li><em>Rank</em> is the number that shows
GNU Backgammon's rank of the move. All
moves evaluated at a given ply are ranked above those evaluated at a
lesser ply. If you use the 0, 1, 2, etc, buttons below the hint list
to re-evaluate one or more moves, the moves will be moved
accordingly. Therefore, for accurate results when re-evaluating a
move that you are interested in, it is usually best to
<em>re-evaluate all moves above it in the list</em>. 
(And slipping with the mouse and re-evaluating, e.g., a 3-ply move
at 2-ply may make the move <em>disappear</em> down to
the bottom of the list!)

     <li><em>Type</em> is a description of the evaluation
that was used to calculate the results. Cubeful means that it is
taking into account the possibility that someone may double. 
Occasionally you may see several moves with the equity of -1.000,
(See <em>Equity</em> below), despite significantly
different winning percentiles. This is because it thinks that if any
of these moves are played then the opponent will double and you
should pass. The n-ply is the depth to which GNU
Backgammon analyzed the move.

     <li><em>Win</em> is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be won by a
single game, gammon or backgammon.

     <li><em>Wg</em> is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be won by a
gammon or backgammon.

     <li><em>Wbg</em> is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be won by a
backgammon.

     <li><em>Loose</em> is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be lost by a
single game, gammon or backgammon. (Notice that this number is equal
to 1 - Win)

     <li><em>Lg</em> is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be lost by a
gammon or backgammon.

     <li><em>Lbg</em> is the fractions of games that
GNU Backgammon thinks will be lost by a
backgammon.

     <li><em>Equity</em> is the overall evaluation of the
position by the program, after considering the different win/loss
percentiles, the cube position, and the match score. A 1.000 would
mean that you are expected to win a point, a 0.000 would mean that
it is roughly equal, and a -1.000 that you are expected to lose a
point. When the evaluation is cubeful this number is not computable
by the win/loss brake down of the previous columns.

     <li><em>Diff.</em> is the difference in equity,
perceived in comparison to the top ranked move.

     <li><em>Move</em> is the move being evaluated. In the
case of a red line, it is the move that was played.
