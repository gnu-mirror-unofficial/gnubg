<a href="#TOCintroduction" id="introduction">Introduction to GNU Backgammon</a>
</h4>

   <p>GNU Backgammon (GNUbg)
plays and analyzes backgammon games and matches. It is able to play and
analyze both money games and tournament matches, evaluate and roll out
positions, and more. Driven by a command-line interface, it displays an
ASCII rendering of a board on text-only terminals, but also allows the
user to play games and manipulate positions with a <a href="board.png">graphical GTK+
	interface</a>. GNU Backgammon is
extensible on platforms which support Python.
</p>

   <p>GNU Backgammon is a world
class opponent and rates at over 2000 on FIBS, the First Internet
Backgammon Server.

   <p>The following features can be found in the current release of
GNU Backgammon.

     <ul>
<li>A command line interface (with full command editing features if
GNU readline is available) that lets you play matches and sessions
against GNU Backgammon with a rough ASCII representation of the board
on text terminals.

     <li>Support for a GTK+ interface with a graphical board window. Both
2D and 3D graphics are available.

     <li>Tournament match and money session cube handling and cubeful play. 
All governed by an underlying cubeless money game based
neuralnet.

     <li>Support for both 1-sided and 2-sided bearoff databases: 1-sided
bearoff database for 15 checkers on the first 6 points and optional
2-sided database kept in memory. Optional larger 1-sided and 2-sided
databases stored on disk.

     <li>Automated rollouts of positions, with lookahead and race variance
reduction where appropriate. Rollouts may be extended.

     <li>Automatic and manual annotation (analysis and commentary) of games
and matches.

     <li>Record keeping of statistics of players in games and matches (both
native inside GNU
Backgammon and externally using relational databases and
Python).

     <li>Loading and saving analyzed games and matches as .sgf files (Smart
Game Format).

     <li>Exporting positions, games and matches to: (.eps) Encapsulated
Postscript, (.gam) Jellyfish Game, (.html) HTML, (.mat) Jellyfish
Match, (.pdf) PDF, (.png) Portable Network Graphics, (.pos) Jellyfish
Position, (.ps) PostScript, (.sgf) GNU Backgammon File, (.tex) LaTeX,
(.txt) Plain Text, (.txt) Snowie Text

     <li>Import of matches and positions from a number of file
       formats: (.bgf) BGRoom Game, (.gam) GammonEmpire Game,
       (.gam) PartyGammon Game, (.mat) Jellyfish Match,
       (.pos) Jellyfish Position, (.sgf) GNU Backgammon File,
       (.sgg) GridGammon Save Game, (.tmg) TrueMoneyGames,
       (.txt) Snowie Text
     <li>Python Scripting ability.

     <li>Native language support; 14 languages complete or in
progress: (cs_CZ, da_DK, en_GB; en_US, fr_FR, de_DE, el_GR, is_IS,
it_IT, ja_JP, ro_RO, ru_RU, es_ES and tr_TR)
</ul>

<a href="#TOCdownloading" id="downloading">Downloading GNU Backgammon</a>
</h4>

<p>
  Anonymous CVS access to the source repository is
  <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gnubg">available</a>. The current code is generally stable although less tested than the released versions.
</p>

<p>
  GNU Backgammon should build on any reasonably recent POSIX environment. The only mandatory prerequisite is the availability of GLib, version 2.8 or higher. Optional features may have more prerequisites, though.
</p>

<p>
  The source archive of the most recent release is <a href="http://files.gnubg.org/media/sources/gnubg-release-1.06.002-sources.tar.gz">gnubg-release-1.06.002-sources.tar.gz</a>.
</p>

<p>
 GNU Backgammon is usually available as a binary package in Linux distributions and included in BSD and macOS ports repositories.
</p>

<p>
  To install it on Windows, use
  <a href="http://files.gnubg.org/media/windows/gnubg-1_06_002-20180802-setup.exe">gnubg-1_06_002-20180802-setup.exe</a>.
