<h4>
<a href="#TOCintroduction" id="introduction">Introduction to GNU Backgammon</a>
</h4>

<p>GNU Backgammon (gnubg) plays and analyses backgammon games and matches.</p>
<p>It is currently a work-in-progress.  So far it is
  able to play both independent games and tournament matches,
  evaluate and roll out positions, tune its own evaluation functions using
  either <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/massdist/tdl.html">TD</a> or
  supervised training, maintain databases of positions for training and other
  purposes, and more. See the following section for a more complete list.
<p>

<p>
  It is driven by a command-line interface, and
  displays an ASCII rendition of a board on text-only terminals, but
  also allows the user to play games and manipulate positions with a
  <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>
  <a href="board.png">board window (png 117k)</a> where available.
  It is extensible on platforms which support
  <a href="/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a> and/or Python.
  <p>

  It currently plays at about the level of a championship flight
  tournament player (depending on its parameters and its luck in
  recent games, it rates at around 2000 on
  <a href="http://www.fibs.com/">FIBS</a>, the First Internet Backgammon
  Server -- at its best, it is in the top 5 of over 6000 rated
  players there) and is gradually improving; it should
  be somewhat stronger than this when released. GNU Backgammon can be
  played at numerous other online backgammon servers.
</p>

<h4>
<a href="#TOCfeatures" id="features">Features in GNU Backgammon</a>
</h4>

<p>The following features can be found in the current prelease 0.14.2
of GNU Backgammon. Note that some of the features and experimental
and/or in progress:

<ul>
  <li>Tournament match and money session cube handling</li>
  <li>A command line interface (with full command editing features if GNU
  readline is available) that lets you play matches and sessions against
  gnubg.</li>
  <li>Support for either a GTK+ interface with a graphical board window, or
  a rough ASCII representation of a board on text terminals. For the
  GTK+ interface both 2D and 3D graphics are available.</li>
  <li>Functions to generate legal moves and evaluate positions at varying
  search depths.</li>
  <li>Neural net functions for giving cubeless evaluations of all other
  contact and race positions.</li>
  <li>Support for both 1-sided and 2-sided bearoff databases: 1-sided
  bearoff database for 15 chequers on the first 6 points and optional
  2-sided database kept in memory.  Optional larger 1-sided and 2-sided
  databases stored on disk.</li>
  <li>Automated rollouts of positions, with lookahead and race variance
  reduction where appropriate. Rollouts may also be extended.</li>
  <li>Both TD(0) and supervised training of neural net weights.</li>
  <li>Position databases for supervised training (if GNU dbm is
  available).</li>
  <li>Loading and saving .sgf games and matches (.sgf files are in the
  Smart Game Format).</li>
  <li>Exporting games and matches to HTML, LaTeX, .mat, PDF, PNG, PostScript
  and plain text formats.</li>
  <li>Importing .bkg, .mat, .pos, .sgg, .tmg and FIBS "oldmoves"
  files.</li>
  <li>Scripting ability (if GNU Guile or Python is available).</li>
  <li>Automatic and manual annotation (analysis and commentary) of games and
  matches.</li>
  <li>Record keeping of statistics of players in games and
  matches (both native inside gnubg and externally using relational
  databases and Python).</li>
  <li>Native language support; 10 languages complete or in progress:
  (cs_CZ, da_DK, en_GB; en_US, fr_FR, de_DE, is_IS, it_IT, ja_JP, and
  tr_TR)
</ul>
  
<h4>
<a href="#TOCdownloading" id="downloading">Downloading GNU Backgammon</a>
</h4>

<p>
If you can tolerate the rough edges, periodic pre-releases of the
  source will be made on <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/">the
  alpha.gnu.org FTP server</a>. The current pre-release is <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/README.txt">0.14.2</a>.</p>

<p>
Anonymous CVS access to the very latest code
 is <a
 href="https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gnubg">available</a>. Do
 not expect this code to be stable; it will generally 
 include both more features and more bugs than the main pre-release
 version.
</p>

<p>
Binary versions of the pre-releases as well as a lot of other stuff
can be found at <a href="http://www.gnubg.org/">http://www.gnubg.org</a>.
