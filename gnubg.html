<ol>GNU Backgammon (gnubg) plays and analyses backgammon games and matches.
  <p>

  It is currently a work-in-progress.  So far it is
  able to play both independent games and tournament matches,
  evaluate and roll out positions, tune its own evaluation functions using
  either <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/massdist/tdl.html">TD</a> or
  supervised training, maintain databases of positions for training and other
  purposes, and more.
  <p>

  It is driven by a command-line interface, and
  displays an ASCII rendition of a board on text-only terminals, but
  also allows the user to play games and manipulate positions with a
  <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>
  <a href="board.png">board window (png 86k)</a> where available.
  It is extensible on platforms which support
  <a href="/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a>.
  <p>

  It currently plays at the level of an advanced to open flight
  tournament player (depending what parameters are used, it rates 
  between the high 1800s and low 2000s on
  <a href="http://www.fibs.com/">FIBS</a>, the First Internet Backgammon
  Server -- at its best, it is in the top 5 of over 6000 rated
  players there) and is gradually improving; it should
  be somewhat stronger than this when released. Since almost all of the CPU
  time required during supervised training is spent performing rollouts, and
  rollouts can easily be performed in parallel, it is hoped that users will
  be able to pool rollout results and collectively train it to a level
  stronger than any individual could obtain.
  <p>

If you can tolerate the rough edges, periodic pre-releases of the
  source will be made on <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/">the
  alpha.gnu.org FTP server</a>.<p>

Anonymous CVS access to the very latest code
 is available: if you have a CVS client, set <tt>CVSROOT</tt> to
 <tt>:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvs</tt> and check out module
 <tt>gnubg</tt>.  If not, daily snapshots of the CVS repository are
 made available by <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/snapshots/">FTP</a>,
 or you can browse the repository through the
 <a href="http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnubg/">WWW gateway</a>.
 Do not expect this code to be stable; it will generally include both more
 features and more bugs than the main pre-release version.<p>

The <a href="/manual/gnubg/">GNU Backgammon manual</a> is available on the WWW
 as well as in the distribution, but bear in mind that this manual is still
 being completed and might not correspond to any particular version of
 <tt>gnubg</tt>.  Please <a href="mailto:bug-gnubg@gnu.org">send comments</a>
 if you would like to improve or extend the manual.<p>

You can also compete against recent versions of gnubg on FIBS;
 it plays there under the names "gnu", "mgnutest", "mpgnu" and
 "gnu_one_ply".<p>
